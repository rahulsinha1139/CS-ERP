## üìù Developer Notes

**Files Modified (Oct 6, 2025)**:
- `src/components/compliance/compliance-form-modal.tsx` (422 lines) ‚úÖ
- `src/components/compliance/compliance-details-modal.tsx` (283 lines) ‚úÖ
- `src/components/compliance/compliance-delete-dialog.tsx` (59 lines) ‚úÖ
- `src/server/api/routers/compliance.ts` (+95 lines for delete & markComplete) ‚úÖ
- `pages/compliance/index.tsx` (fully wired with state & mutations) ‚úÖ

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Using Radix UI Dialog for all modals
- React Hook Form + Zod for validation
- tRPC mutations with optimistic updates
- Cache invalidation via `utils.compliance.*.invalidate()`
- Dual-mode form (create/edit) based on `complianceId` prop

**Security Considerations**:
- All endpoints are protected procedures (session validation)
- Ownership verification before delete (companyId check)
- Input validation via Zod schemas
- XSS prevention via React (auto-escaping)

**Dev Server**: ‚úÖ Running at http://localhost:3000
**Compilation**: ‚úÖ Zero errors
**Components**: ‚úÖ All created and wired
